Currently, the warning below is thrown, as the app isn't wrapped in an <SSRProvider> tag for react-bootstrap - I've not done this is that causes more errors that stop the app from working, so I'm going to hold off for a bit until the app/ directory in Next JS 13 is fully rolled out

Warning: `When server rendering, you must wrap your application in an <SSRProvider> to ensure consistent ids are generated between the client and server.`
